# Startup your team

### Come up with a team name
Creativity encouraged. Vowels encouraged as well.

### Design a logo!
If you are not design inclined, you might want to ask someone who is for a favor or select an open source image.

### Create your team's home page
The TTeam will create a repository for your team. **This repo is for your team's documentation: This Github Readme.md file has to be the jumping off point to your documentation.**  This repository and documetation should evolve over time with your project.  We encourage you to use the built in Wiki that Github provides, although you are free to use what feels most sustainable for your team as long as you link to it from your Github readme.md homepage. **Two examples of Wiki based documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cs210/Hella/wiki) and [here](https://github.com/StanfordCS194/StanFood/wiki).** Please note you can also store your source code in this same repo for a one stop shop experience or you may ask the TTeam to create you a second repository for your code to have documentation and code in separate repositories if you prefer that arrangement.

Create a new team home page (using README.md) in your team's home repo that includes at least the following:
- **Your team name**
- **Team logo**
- **Team member photos, names**
- **A synopsis of your project**
- **Links for team communication:** how we should get in touch with you, how you keep in touch with each other - Slack, email, etc.
    
### Sign up for a Wednesday meeting slot (you will be meeting at this time every Wednesday after the first week)
Time slots are first come first serve. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rDJ3dP8oelAbo8V7ZJ8_D4lJEK5Y9E6DjHdITDSu3J8/edit#gid=0)

### Create a team skills matrix
Make a table showing areas of expertise relevant to your project and showing gaps that will likely need filling. 

You can do this [directly in your README.md](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables), embed a picture, or link a document.

An example is below. You may want to use the 6 Hats Survey results and other data then what is shown in this example.

Member | Skills | Personal Traits | Desired Growth | Weaknesses
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Jose | User testing, CAD, Statistical Data | Very sensitive to work environment | Programming | Programming

Juan | AI, Machine Learning, Programming, GUI skills | Loves learning new programming languages | MatLAB | bad memory
Andrew | Machine Learning, Audio recording, Signal processing, Statistical analysis | Strong opinions, very abstract thinker, Big PIcture guy | Rapid prototyping, project management | Sensitive to environments

### Start benchmarking and need finding per todayâ€™s lecture
You should start figuring out what might be a good project or product for your team to pursue. 

Come up with ideas. Interview your potential users. Your future is **up to you**.

### Have fun!
